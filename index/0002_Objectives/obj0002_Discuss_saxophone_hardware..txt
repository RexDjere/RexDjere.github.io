**Objective: **obj0002 Discuss saxophone hardware.

**Summary**
The choice saxophone hardware is a deeply personal one. My advise: make your choice and stick with it. 

**Deep Dive**
I play a Selmer Referene 54 alto sax with a Yanagisawa 5 metal mouthpiece, and #4 Fibracell reeds. I don't change my setup at all because changes introduce uncertainty, and uncertainty is the enemy of progress. 

I also play a Roland AE-10 digital wind instrument. This allows me to practice silently.
